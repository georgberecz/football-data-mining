## Goals
We chose this data because it is about the game we all love. The goals of this project were to find some interesting patterns or rules that one football fan might not see himself and maybe prove or bust some myths that we had. For example, do your chances of winning a game increase when you lead at half time or whether having loads of corner kicks more than your opponent increases your chances of winning a football match. In addition, we wanted to know which referees are more card-happy than others and which leagues follow more fair-play principles. English league has always been considered by football fans as a league where referees tend to let game play whereas Italian league has always been considered as the most tactical and defensive league. We aim to find out if these are misconceptions or not.

## Structure
The analysis was done using R. The code is spread across .r files in the root folder of the project.
