## Goals
We chose this data because it is about the game we all love. The goals of this project were to find some interesting patterns or rules that one football fan might not see himself and maybe prove or bust some myths that we had. For example, do your chances of winning a game increase when you lead at half time or whether having loads of corner kicks more than your opponent increases your chances of winning a football match. In addition, we wanted to know which referees are more card-happy than others and which leagues follow more fair-play principles. English league has always been considered by football fans as a league where referees tend to let game play whereas Italian league has always been considered as the most tactical and defensive league. We aim to find out if these are misconceptions or not.

## Structure
The analysis was done using R. The code is spread across .r files in the root folder of the project.
#### 1. Teams aggressiveness across the countries based on the yellow and red cards given.

First of all, in order to analyze teams agressiveness data needed to be sorted. The games and countries that didn't have any data about cards given were removed. 

The following countries didn't have any information about cards given in their league games:
 - Netherlands
 - Portugal
 - Turkey

The following countries had data about the cards for at least one season:
 - England
 - France
 - Germany
 - Italy
 - Spain

Let's take a look into the results by country (NB: These are average results):

##### England
 - Home team yellow cards per game: 1.36
 - Away team yellow cards per game: 1.77
 - Home team red cards per game: 0.07
 - Away team red cards per game: 0.1
 - The most agressive team in England: Coventry - 2 yellows cards per game on average.
 - The most calm team in England: Ipswitch - 0.94 yellow cards per game on average.

##### France
 - Home team yellow cards per game: 1.52
 - Away team yellow cards per game: 1.89
 - Home team red cards per game: 0.09
 - Away team red cards per game: 0.14
 - The most agressive team in France: Ajaccio GFCO - 2.34 yellows cards per game on average.
 - The most calm team in France: Lorient - 1.34 yellow cards per game on average.
 
##### Germany
 - Home team yellow cards per game: 1.73
 - Away team yellow cards per game: 2.1

 - The most calm team in Italy: Bari - 1.7 yellow cards per game on average.

##### Spain
 - Home team yellow cards per game: 2.44
 - Away team yellow cards per game: 2.74
 - Home team red cards per game: 0.15
 - Away team red cards per game: 0.2
 - The most agressive team in Spain: Vallecano - 3.02 yellows cards per game on average.
 - The most calm team in Spain: Barcelona - 1.84 yellow cards per game on average.
 - It is also worth mentioning that there is a team in Spain called Xerex, who receives 0.37 red cards per game!

Now, to take everything together with one plot we can see the average red and yellow cards received by countries:
![alt tag](https://github.com/georgberecz/football-data-mining/blob/master/Number_Of_Cards_Per_Game.png)
We can clearly see from the above image that England is the least aggressive country by cards given. But if we think of it from another corner then perhaps the referees are not so strict and let the game be more aggressive? Probably of the 2 combined. Also it is quite clear that Spain has the highest average on cards given per game, both red and yellow cards.
